# Particle Physics ML Tutorial

  ## Preparation
  
  ### 1. Make sure that you have an INPAC cluster account and a terminal to visit it
  You can contact **chenxun@sjtu.edu.cn** and CC your advisor to get one.

  ### 2. Python is our language
  Python is much easier than C++. I will teach some in the class and you can also learn from this website **https://www.runoob.com/python/python-socket.html**
  
  ### 3. IDE is strongly recommended
  I use Pycharm. SJTU has bought the Professional edition for us. As long as you have an active JAccount, you can download Pycharm Professional from this website

  ### 4. Git clone my code
  Log in to the INPAC cluster
  
    cd <Directory-You-Prefer>
    git clone https://github.com/Tom0126/ParticlePhysicsMLTutorial-.git
    cd
